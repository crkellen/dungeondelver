# dungeondelver
A JavaScript game by crkellen. Game engine is self made, and it's rendered with HTML Canvas, so it should work with all modern browsers (absolutely no compatibility testing done though). Originally crkellen's first attempt at JavaScript, so the game is small and simple. A year later Dorover picked it up to clean a game breaking bug out of it, and then kept/keeps on developing it further whenever he felt/feels like it.

At some point in the future crkellen might refactor the game.
