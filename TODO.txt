TODO list:
--Enemies moving
--Stat bars
Enemy fighting
HP potions should heal
Turn based or real time? (Or maybe implement both? In real time moving/actions could have 0.1 second delay so you can't move-hit-move in a very short time frame)
Coins? (Money for some sort of purchases or just score?) (A sprite already exists)
Chests? (Need to draw a sprite for a closed chest, open one exists)
Keys? (For either a chest, or the stairs down. In the first case we could spawn a random amount of keys (like 0 = 50%, 1 = 45%, 2 = 5%), in the latter one key per floor)
Bosses?
Different mobs? (If chests are added as well, Mimics could be cool)

Next up:
Give the player 0.350-0.5 seconds between every movement so all the animations can finish.

Bugs:
The game sometimes logs "ERROR: Collision Check Enemy".
If the player moves while something is in the middle of an animation, that something leaves a false duplicate image.
If the player tries to attack an enemy who is in the middle of attacking (attacking frame), the player can't kill that enemy (because he's collisioning with 301, not 3).
