TODO list:
--Enemies moving
--Stat bars
Enemy fighting
Turn based or real time? (Or maybe implement both? In real time moving/actions could have 0.1 second delay so you can't move-hit-move in a very short time frame)
HP potions should heal
Coins? (Money for some sort of purchases or just score?) (A sprite already exists)
Chests? (Need to draw a sprite for a closed chest, open one exists)
Keys? (For either a chest, or the stairs down. In the first case we could spawn a random amount of keys (like 0 = 50%, 1 = 45%, 2 = 5%), in the latter one key per floor)
Bosses?
Different mobs? (If chests are added as well, Mimics could be cool)
-----
Next up:
Give the enemies some sort of an attack (can this be done with an animation cell/image? For example when an enemy attacks, change its image to another one for 0.3 seconds)

Bugs:
Check out what happens if you remove all the "cMap[119] = 1;" lines? Does it break the map generation? (Tile 119 is bottom right corner of top room-line.)
